###what is BCI?
   A brain–computer interface (BCI), sometimes called a mind-machine interface (MMI), direct neural interface (DNI), or brain–machine interface (BMI), is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.

###how to take the brain signal
   Use signal collector like Emotiv Epoc,and transfrom it to digital signal withFast Fourier Transform,then you can analysis it.difference frequency of signal have difference mean.in this demo,i use data arrange in 1-32Hz to express the change with pressure of brain 

###device
   Emotiv Epoc
